# User Story
- We should include a complimentary tool in our software package for printing QR codes specifically designed for restaurants. The process begins with the user opening their camera program or QR scanner app to scan the QR code attached to each table. Upon scanning the QR code, the menu page will be displayed, featuring the name, ingredients, and price of each menu item. Each item should include a quantity counter, allowing the user to add or remove items as desired.

- Once the user clicks the order button, a confirmation popup will appear, showing the details of each selected item and its corresponding quantity. The user can then confirm the transaction. After submitting the orders, the cashier will receive the requests and approve them. Additionally, the system can include a feature for rejecting orders if needed.

- Upon approval, the requests will be forwarded to the kitchen page. In the kitchen, staff members can change the state of each request from "pending" to "being prepared" and finally "done." If the kitchen marks an order as "done," it will be returned to the cashier page. The cashier will then send a request to the customer, prompting them to come and pay for their order.

- Once the user submits the order, they will be directed to the waiting room. The order status will change dynamically based on updates from the cashier and kitchen. If the user wishes to do so, they can click on the "Review the Service" button to provide feedback on their experience.

- Furthermore, the owner will have the ability to add new items to the menu, edit existing menu items, and delete items from the menu. They will also have access to view the feedback collected from users, providing valuable insights about the restaurant's performance.
