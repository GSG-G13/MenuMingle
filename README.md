# User Story
- As a user, I am going to do the following:

I will open my camera program or QR scanner app to scan the QR code attached to each table. This will display the menu page, showing the name, ingredients, and price of each menu item. I can adjust the quantity of each item as desired and add them to my cart.

After selecting the desired items and adding them to my cart, I can review the contents of my cart. The cart will display the details of each selected item and its corresponding quantity. I can make changes to the quantities or remove items from my cart if needed.

Once I am satisfied with the items in my cart, I can proceed to the checkout process. At this point, I will be prompted to provide my payment information. The payment gateway will securely process my payment details, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of my information.

After successfully completing the payment process, I will receive a confirmation of the transaction. The order will be sent to the kitchen for preparation, and the order status will be updated accordingly.

- As a member of the restaurant staff, my capabilities will depend on my role within the establishment. Here are the tasks I can perform based on different roles:

   - If I am the owner:
        I have the authority to manage the menu by adding new dishes, modifying existing ones, and removing items as needed. This can be done through the dashboard provided to me.

  - If I am a cook:
       I am responsible for receiving orders from the system and preparing the dishes accordingly. Once a dish is prepared, I can update its status to "done" in the system, indicating that it is ready for serving.
